# Video Metadata Scrubber
The objective of this project is to develop a Video Metadata Scrubber, a computer security tool designed to enhance user privacy and security when sharing
and storing video files. This tool aims to help users protect sensitive metadata
associated with video files, including location data, timestamps, and author
information. By scrubbing this metadata, the tool will contribute to safeguarding user privacy and reducing the risk of sensitive information exposure when
sharing or storing video content.
